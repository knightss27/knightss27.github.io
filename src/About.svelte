  <h1>Hi, my name is Seth!</h1>
  <p>
    I am a current high school junior interested in web development and computer
    graphics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially, I love writing visual code. I write a lot of stuff for the web
    using Svelte or React, but have also written quite a bit in Java (both with
    Processing and for school classes), and less so in Python and Go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of writing code, I play bass and lead both the Mock Trial and Speech & Debate teams at my school.
