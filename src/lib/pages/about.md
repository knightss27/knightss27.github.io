Hi there! I'm a second-year at The University of Chicago, planning on majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Physics.
<br><br>
I'm interested in many things - but mostly rockets and robots. I am an active member of both [UChicago Robotics](https://uchicagorobotics.webflow.io/) and [SEDS-UChicago](https://seds.org/), where I work on mechanical design and flight avionics respectively.
<br><br>
As it stands, I've written in many programming languages - most significantly: C, Javascript, Python and Java. I started programming about 5 years ago and have (for the most part) loved it since.
Outside of writing code, I play bass and previously captained both the Mock Trial and Speech & Debate teams at my high school.
