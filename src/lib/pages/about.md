Hi there! I'm a second-year at The University of Chicago, majoring in Physics with a minor in Computer Science.
<br><br>
I'm interested in many things - but mostly satellites, rockets, and robots. I am an active member of both [UChicago Robotics](https://uchicagorobotics.webflow.io/), where I lead the combat robotics side of things, and [SEDS-UChicago](https://voices.uchicago.edu/seds/), where I am the Head of Optical Payload for our in-development CubeSat, PULSE-A.
<br><br>
As it stands, I've written in many programming languages - most significantly: C, Javascript, Python and Java. I started programming about 5 years ago and have (for the most part) loved it since. I also recently fell in love with optics, especially for space and semiconductor applications.
